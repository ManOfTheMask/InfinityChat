# Infinity Chat

Infinity Chat is a client-based chat application where all encryption is performed in the browser. The platform stores only encrypted messages and public keysâ€”your private keys remain secure and are never saved.

### The Plan
This is a selfhostable chat app meant for small to medium size groups who want to talk to each other with pgp with the convenience of the encryption being integrated into the chat.

It will use pocketbase to have a portable small db to hold encrypted messages, public keys/users, and chatroom/dm data such as title of chat etc.
It will use openpgp.js mainly on the client side to handle encryption/decryption, private keys, and other sensitive stuff while the server side will only have functions need for connecting people through websockets, db handling, security challenges with public key etc.
It will also have tailwindcss for styling and expressjs for a minimal webserver with express handlebars for html templating and all while using typescript

### How To Run
Use "npm run build" and then "npm run start" for production version.
Use "npm run dev" to start application in dev mode.
